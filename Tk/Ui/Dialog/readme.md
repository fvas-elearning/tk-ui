__Dialog Package__

So this is a complete mess...

I want to create an entirely new dialog suite of objects.

     Dialog
       |
       |--> AjaxSelect          // Select from a list of Mapped objects
       |--> Form                // Allows us to place a form inside a dialog
       |--> ...
       |
